**What Next**


Now that you have an idea of what the epsilon package provides,
you should investigate the parts of the package most useful for
you.  

:doc:`API</reference/index>` provides details on epsilon.

:doc:`/examples/index` provides some example models written using epsilon.

Further Reading
---------------
A good knowledge of how epsilon works under the bonnet will help enhance your productivity further.

The Python programming language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At it's core epsilon is built in Python.
Python is a powerful programming language that actually makes sense. Equally important, Python is free, well-supported, and people enjoy using it.

Knowledge of Python is not essential and in fact the purpose of this project is to reduce the complexity of using python for modelling. However if you are looking to develop it then you will want to know how to write basic programs in Python. Among the many guides to Python, we recommend this python documentation: http://python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

The Anaconda Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The best way to get started with python is by downloading the anaconda distribution which downloads many useful libraries with it.
Read more about it here: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html or download it here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads/

The Jupyter Notebook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The editor that we use is called the jupyter notebook (previously IPython Notebook). It is both human readable and executable to allow for a fully documented workflow. It's always good to know how to use your gui so read more here: https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Pandas
~~~~~~
epsilon's Data object builds heavily on pandas. A library that provides an efficient dataframe and data analysis functionality. Anything you can do with pandas dataframe you can also do with a epsilon Data object.
Read more about that here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/tutorials.html

Bokeh
~~~~~
epsilon's plotting functionality is implemented using the bokeh library. A great library for interactive visualisations.
A gallery of charts with source code can be found here: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html
